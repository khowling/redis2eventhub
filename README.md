## Send JSON data from a *Redis List* into *Azure Event Hub*, 

A console app that opens a Link to *Azure Event Hub*, pops JSON messages from a redis List using blocking call (brpop), and sends to the event hub using the AMQP 1.0 protocol.  Continounsly runs, message flow control is observed using "Link Credits". Use Ctrl-C to stop.

to install and run (have node installed - version required in package.json)




## Files

* `index.js` pop data from a Redis queue to an Azure eventhub   
  * (`index_pub_sub.js` same for pub/sub)
* `rx.js` receive data from the hub (just for debugging verification)
* `test-bench.js`testing, pumps data into redis using a cluster for 4 processes 
  * (`test-bench_pub.js` same for pub/sub)
* `test-bench-direct.js` pumps random data directly into EventHub (no Redis) 

### environment variables

* `REDIS_URL`:     \<default: `redis://localhost:6379/3`\>
* `REDIS_CHANNEL`: The Redis List Key \<default: `clickpath`\>
* `AMQP_URL`:     The Azure Servicebus AMQP Url <example: 'amqps://\<AccessKeyName\>:\<AccessKey\>@\<namespace\>.servicebus.windows.net'
* `ENTITY_PATH`:  The Azure eventhub Entity name
* `DEBUG="amqp10:client"`:  to debug (or for full debugging "amqp10:*")

(in lunix `ENV_VAR="value"`, in windows `$env:ENV_VAR = "value"`)


### just background reading

#### Azure EventHub
--------------
Event Hub has Publishers and Consumers.

Event Hubs uses a partitioned consumer pattern in which each consumer only reads a specific subset, or partition, of the message stream. Partitions are a data organization mechanism and are  related to the degree of downstream parallelism required in consuming applications than to Event Hubs throughput. Partitions retain data for a configured retention time that is set at the Event Hub level. This setting applies across all partitions in the Event Hub. Events expire on a time basis; you cannot explicitly delete them.  The choice of the number of partitions in an Event Hub directly related to the number of concurrent readers you expect to have, it is generally best to avoid sending data to specific partitions.

A partition key is a value that is used to map incoming event data into specific partitions for the purposes of data organization.  If you don't specify a partition key when publishing an event, a round robin assignment is used

A consumer group is a view (state, position, or offset) of an entire Event Hub. Consumer groups enable multiple consuming applications to each have a separate view of the event stream, and to read the stream independently at their own pace and with their own offsets.  If you want to write event data to long-term storage, then that storage writer application is a consumer group. Complex event processing is performed by another, separate consumer group. You can only access partitions through a consumer group. There is always a default consumer group in an Event Hub ($Default), and you can create up to 20 consumer groups 


#### AMQP - Advanced Message Queuing Protocol
----------------------------------------
Connections are over TCP sockets, and agree a maximum frame size (or message size), thus protecting the receiving device, additionally, every max number of channels, sessions
Links may be established in order to receive or send messages, they are group together in a bidirectional Session, and multiplex over a Connection between 2 peers. The basic unit of data in AMQP is a frame, there are 'frame bodies' to initiate, control and tear down the transfer of messages, frame bodies are:
* attach / detach : initiate / teardown a new link
* transfer : send a message over a link, each message needs to be 'settled' (sender and receiver agree on the state of the transfer)
* disposition : changes in state and settlement for a transfer (or set of transfers) are communicated 
 * (various reliability guarantees can be enforced this way: at-most-once, at-least-once and exactly-once)
  * fire-and-forget - assumed settled, no feedback, unreliable but cheep
  * at-least-once - required sellmentment, the reply dispostion will communicate the sellment
* flow : allow a subscribing link to pull messages as and when desired
* begin / end : create / end a session between two peers that is initiated with a begin frame and terminated with an end frame
